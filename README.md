# code-generator

For this application I have modified JavaScript code to create a random passord generator. To accomplish this I used functions, arrays, for loops, and if else statements.
I tested function of the application using the console and using the website itself. The application functions properly, generating alerts for wrong input and generating random passwords with correct input.
